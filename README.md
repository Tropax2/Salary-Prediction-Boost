# Salary Prediction using Boost 

In this project we use boost to predict the salary of baseball players in the season 1986 and 1987 seasons. The dataset is included in the files
since it comes from the book Introduction to Statistical Learning by James, Witten, Hastie, Tibshirani and Taylor.

## The Objective

The objective of this project is to study how both the training and test mean squared error evolve as the learning rate (also known as the shrinkage parameter) changes. Boosting is performed using the `scikit-learn`'s `GradientBoostingRegressor`. To isolate the effect of the learning rate, all other model parameters are kept fixed.
